IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

As of October 2020, we, the Visual Pinball team, are working on replacing
the inherited 'old MAME'-like license (listed directly below) by
the GPLv3+ License (listed at the very end of this file).

So note that all new contributions (e.g. via pull requests) being made will
automatically be considered as GPLv3+ based.

Each source file/snippet that is already under GPLv3+ will have its
very first line marked with
// license:GPLv3+
Every file/snippet that doesn't, will stay (for now) under the 'old MAME'-like license.


For thirdparty licenses, see txt\license.txt
